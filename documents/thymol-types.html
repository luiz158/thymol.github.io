    <h2>thymol types</h2>
<p>In creating a JavaScript emulation of a Java framework, it has been necessary to make some compromises with the use of data types associated with the Expression Utility Objects, these are summarised here.</p>
<h3>list and array types</h3>
<p>As far as Thymol is concerned, List and Array types are interchangeable and are represented by the JavaScript native Array type.</p>
<h3>date and calendar types</h3>
<p>As far as Thymol is concerned, Date and Calendar types are interchangeable and are represented by the JavaScript native Date type.</p>
<h3>set and map types</h3>
<p>Thymol includes implementations Set and Map that emulate the Java equivalents as far as is necessary for the Expression Utility Objects to work. These implementations are ThSet and ThMap respectively. </p>
<p>ThSet exports the following functions:</p>
<pre><code>        add = function(key)
        addAll = function(keys)
        clear = function()
        contains = function(key)
        containsAll = function(keys)
        isEmpty = function()
        size = function()
        remove = function(key)
        toArray = function()
        toString = function()</code></pre><p>There is another utility function that constructs a ThSet from an Array (removing duplicate keys in the process)</p>
<pre><code>        ThSet.prototype.fromArray = function(array)
</code></pre><p>ThMap extends ThSet and additionally exports the following functions:</p>
<pre><code>        containsKey = function(key)
        containsValue = function(value)
        entrySet = function()
        get = function(key)
        keySet = function()
        put = function(key, value)
        putAll = function(collection)
        values = function()</code></pre>
