            <h3>what is thymol?</h3>
			<p>Thymol is a client-side javascript implementation of the popular server-side Thymeleaf Java template engine.</p> 
			<p>Thymol 2.0 provides the facility to prototype Thymeleaf 2.1 template based designs without having to run a web application server.</p>
			<p>You don't need to be running tomcat or jetty or any other servlet engine, you can do everything on your local file system or network file server or use a plain old web server (like Apache) if you wish.</p>
			<h3>why write it?</h3>
			<p>Thymol was originally created in order to provide a more accurate static representation of Thymeleaf's dynamic templating capabilities by offering support for Thymeleaf attributes through a statically accessible javascript library.</p>
			<p>Subsequently Thymol has evolved into a highly capable prototyping system for Thymeleaf based designs.</p>
			<p>To read more about why Thymol was started see the <a href="static-imports.html">static imports</a> page.</p>
            <h3>how does it work?</h3>
			<p>At the basic level it can be very simple: you add a single script tag to your Thymeleaf template and load that template directly into your browser.</p>
			<p>To enhance the scope of your prototype you will probably want to add example data, you do this by creating javascript files to configure and/or extend Thymol.</p>
			<p>With Thymol version 2.0 and above, you can easily write javascript to prototype custom Thymeleaf dialects!</p> 
            <h3>what about the name?</h3>
            <p>Thymol is the informal name of the organic molecule 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol, this chemical provides most of the flavour of the thyme leaf.</p>
