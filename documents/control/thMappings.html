    <h2>thMappings</h2>
    <p>Another feature of Thymol is the thMappings structure that defines Thymol mappings.</p>
    <p>Mappings are intended mainly to simplify the translation between URI values within a Thymeleaf template and real world URLs. Mapping URLs may locate resources in the local file system or on the network.</p>
    <p>Mappings are defined in a JavaScript string array of key/value pairs called &quot;thMappings&quot;.</p>
    <p>The mapping translation is applied to template locator values and to URLs defined by Thymeleaf standard URL expressions (@{...}) after any variable substitutions and expression evaluations have been calculated.</p>
    <p>The basic translation made is as follows: if the value of a URI matches a mapping key, then that URI is replaced by the mapping value.</p>
    <p>There is also an "extended" mapping mode which when in force, causes the key match to be found true when the initial substring of a URI value is found to match the key value. (See <a href="thExtendedMapping.html?docu&amp;para">thExtendedMapping</a> section).</p>
    <p>You can enable the extended mapping mode by setting the value of the thExtendedMapping parameter to "true".</p>
    <p>Here is an example mappings definition set:</p>
<pre><code>        var thMappings = [
            [&quot;/webjars/bootstrap/2.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;,        &quot;http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;],
            [&quot;/jquery&quot;,                                               &quot;http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1&quot;],
            [&quot;/thymeleaf&quot;,                                            &quot;/home/fred/projects/new-site/templates&quot;],
            [&quot;/thymeleaf/welcome&quot;,                                    &quot;/home/live/distr/WEB-INF/thymeleaf/welcome&quot;],
            [&quot;/resources&quot;,                                            &quot;/home/fred/projects/new-site/resources&quot;],
            [&quot;/&quot;,                                                     &quot;/home/live/distr/WEB-INF/thymeleaf/welcome.html&quot;]
        ];</code></pre><p>Under this example, a reference to &quot;@{/thymleaf/hello.html}&quot; would be translated into:</p>
    <p>&quot;/home/fred/projects/new-site/templates/hello.html&quot;</p>
    <p>and a reference to &quot;@{/}&quot; would translate to</p>
    <p>&quot;/home/live/distr/WEB-INF/thymeleaf/welcome.html&quot;.</p>
    <p>Tip:</p>
    <p>An effect similar to mapping can be accomplished using thVars, by defining a variable that simulates a URI or even a Thymeleaf function.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>        var thVars = [
           ...
            [&quot;#dates.format(visit.date.toDate(), \&#39;yyyy-MM-dd\&#39;)&quot;,        &quot;2013-07-12&quot;],
           ...
        ];</code></pre><p>This variable simulates the effect of a particular Thymeleaf #dates expression utility.</p>
